# GCViT and Custom Model Repository

This repository contains the training and testing code for the GCViT model, along with a checkpoint for reproducibility. Additionally, it includes a custom model tailored for specific use cases.

## Repository Structure

- **`Train.py`**: Contains the training script for the GCViT model. Includes configuration for data loading, model initialization, and optimization.
- **`Test.py`**: Script to evaluate the GCViT model using test datasets. Outputs key metrics and predictions.
- **`checkpoint/`**: Directory containing pre-trained model weights to resume training or perform inference.
- **`custom_model/`**: Code and configurations for a custom model, designed for advanced use cases.

## Usage

### 1. Setting Up the Environment
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Training the GCViT Model
Run the training script:
```bash
python Train.py 
```

### 3. Testing the GCViT Model
Evaluate the model using the testing script:
```bash
python Test.py 
```
- Replace `model path` with the actual checkpoint filename.

### 4. Using the Custom Model
Navigate to the `custom_model` directory for details on utilizing the custom model:
```bash
cd custom_model
python custom_model_script.py
```

## Checkpoints
Pre-trained weights for GCViT can be found in the `checkpoint/` directory. Load these weights to skip training and directly perform inference or fine-tuning.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.7
- PyTorch >= 1.10
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
